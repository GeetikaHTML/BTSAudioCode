           <p style="color:black">Why are BTS so famous?
Their music — which spans several languages, including Korean, English and Japanese — attracts a global audience, even causing a huge spark in tourism in their home country. In 2020, the HRI reported that at least 796,000 people visited South Korea for BTS.</p>
    <p style="color:black">BTS, also known as the Bangtan Boys, is a South Korean boy band formed in 2010 and debuting in 2013 under Big Hit Entertainment. The septet—consisting of members Jin, Suga, J-Hope, RM, Jimin, V, and Jungkook—co-writes and co-produces much of their own material.</p>
